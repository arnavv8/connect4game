The rules of Connect Four are simple yet challenging:
Players take turns to drop their discs into one of the seven columns.
The discs fall to the lowest available slot within the column.
The first player to connect four discs of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If the grid is completely filled without a four-disc sequence, the game ends in a draw.
